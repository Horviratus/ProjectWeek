# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
We want to implement a neural network based algorithm to segment automatically the upper region of airways in CT images. We have approximately non segmented 40 CT images of the neck in DICOM files, from them we have to segment the airways for the training. For medical or biological images is  a great solution the U-net, that is a special type of neural networks. To compare with other neural nethwork based algorithms, U-net doesn't need a large dataset (~30-40 images enough).

## Objective

1. Objective A. Making a training data set (~30-40 images). Find a quickly and precise way to segment the upper airways in 3D Slicer.
1. Objective B. Make a baseline U-net, in Python whit this dataset.
1. Objective C. Testing the program.
